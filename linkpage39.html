<p>In western Saudi Arabia is a natural wonder that intel recently was pretty unknown to the outside world.</p>

The Harrat Kishb plateau&nbsp;&nbsp;contains many volcanic cones. The bottom of the crater is covered with white&nbsp;sodium phosphate&nbsp;crystals.</p>

<p>Measuring 4km wide and 250-meters deep, the sprawling Al Wahba crater is one of Saudi Arabia&rsquo;s most dramatic natural wonders: a vast hollow with an opaque lake at its heart.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="images/53.jpg" /></p>

<p>The crater was once thought to have been formed by a meteorite crashing to earth, but research by geologists in the 1960s revealed Al Wahbah to be a maar crater. These shallow hollows are caused by volcanic eruptions that occur when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava.</p>

<p>Locals, however, have their own legend of Al Wahbah&rsquo;s creation. According to the tale, the area once held two mountains: Tamia and Cotton. One night, after a flash of lightning illuminated Cotton&rsquo;s beauty, Tamia fell in love with him and vowed to uproot herself to be closer to her beloved. But before she could reach him, her mountain-cousin Shelman became jealous and shot her with an arrow, sending her crashing to the ground. The crater was formed by her fall.</p>
