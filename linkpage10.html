<h3 class="text-primary">Day12: Tabuk Tour – Flight to Jeddah</h3>
<p>Breakfast, Drive to the northwestern city of Tabuk has long been a resting point for Jordanian and Egyptian pilgrims, with a rich Bedouin culture that can be felt in Souq Twaheen, which still supplies patterned rugs and goat-hair tent covers for modern nomads. Today’s Tabuk marks the start of the Saudi coast but is also a base for exploring wild beauty spots and the story of the Prophet Moses, who lived east of the city for a decade. It’s possible to visit the carved tombs of Maghaer Shuaib in the desert, or the Moses Spring near Magna, where natural springs still flow under the date palms. Nearby is the stunning Tayeb Al Ism, a steep granite massif separated from the turquoise-fringed Gulf of Aqaba by only the road. For clear seas and sun-swept beaches, explore the charms of local coastal towns Haql and Sharma.</p><p>

Start your tour visiting the <b>Al-Zeeta Mountains,</b> Arrive and enjoy a sand adventure & looking at the mountains.
</p>
Then enjoy the town of <b>Al Bad’</b> to visit <b>“Magha’er Shuaib”.</b></p><p>

The Maghaer Shuaib seems to appear from nowhere in the reddish desert west of Tabuk — its elegantly carved facades and tombs built into the sandstone rocks recalling Petra in Jordan and Hegra at Al Ula. Having fled Egypt, Moses lived here a decade under the patronage of the Prophet Shuaib, who had been impressed by Moses’ chivalry and offered his daughter’s hand in marriage. Moses eventually returned to Egypt, but it’s easy to imagine that this beautiful place stayed with him.</p>    
<p>
Then we will move to the next visit to the town of <b>Magna</b> and visit to the 12 Springs of Prophet Moses.
</p><p>
Then you will visit the <b>Wadi Tayyib Al Ism </b>and enjoy the majestic mountain views.
